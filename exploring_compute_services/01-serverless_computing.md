With serverless computing, you run applications without managing the underlying infrastructure. In the following lessons, you learn how to take full advantage of it with powerful compute services. You explore AWS Lambda, a serverless solution that automatically handles scaling, availability and maintenance. You also discover services like Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), and AWS Elastic Beanstalk, which makes container management and application deployment more manageable.

## Unmanaged and managed services
With unmanaged compute services like Amazon EC2, AWS takes care of the underlying physical infrastructure, but you're responsible for setting up, securing and maintaining the operating system, network configurations and applications on your instances. Managed services on the other hand reduce the amount of infrastructure you need to manage. While AWS handles much of the operational overhead, you might still need to perform some provisioning or configuration depending on the service.

## Fully-managed services
Fully-managed services-like serverless ones-take abstraction even further, eliminating the need to provision or manage any servers at all. The underlying infrastructure is fully managed by AWS, so you can focus entirely on writing and deploying code. Later in this module, you will explore Lambda. Lambda is a serverless compute service where AWS handles the infrastructure, scaling, and availability, while you remain responsible for securing and managing your application code.
