You are well on your way to creating your resources in your Amazon VPC. At this point, you would consider what type of security you need and filter the traffic coming in and out. Remember security groups and network ACLs? That's where they come in handy! And finally, you'd be ready to add your resources like EC2 instances or databases in your subnets.
