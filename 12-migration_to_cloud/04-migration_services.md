# Migration Services and Tools
No matter where you are in the migration process, you have many AWS services and resources you can use to support your migration journey. In this lesson, you will identify four migration services and locate additional resources to help support you after this training.

## Assess phase

In the Assess phase, it is important to have the right tools to build the business case for your migration. That's where Migration Evaluator can help.

## Migration Evaluator
The Migration Evaluator is a migration assessment service that helps you create a business case for AWS Cloud planning and migration. It does this with a data driven approach, analyzing your current state, target state, and developing a migration readiness plan with projected cloud costs.

**Benefits:** The benefits include removing the guesswork when migrating. It provides visibility into multiple cost-effective cloud migration scenarios. It also gives insights on reusing existing software licensing, which can further reduce costs.
**Use cases:** You can use Migration Evaluator to conduct broad-based discovery, take a snapshot of your current on-premises footprint to fine-tune licensing, view server dependencies, and gain visibility into multiple migration scenarios. You can also use it to estimate and reduce your cloud costs.

## Mobilize phase

Let's look at two services that you might use in the Mobilize phase for discovery and planning.

## Application Discovery Service
The Application Discovery Service discovers on-premises server inventory and connections. It gathers configuration, performance, and connection details for both servers and databases to create a detailed migration plan.
**Benefits:** With Application Discovery Service, you get a comprehensive snapshot of your on-premises inventory. You also can integrate discovery data with other services like Migration Hub and protect the data Application Discovery Service collects.
**Use cases:** You can use the AWS Application Discovery Service to conduct discovery and inventory, map the connections and dependencies, and generate a migration plan.

## Migration Hub
The Migration Hub is a centralized hub to take you from discovery, assessment, planning, and execution of your migration. It provides tools, guidance, and automated recommendations to collaborate with your team and track your migration.
**Benefits:** With the Migration Hub, you have one location to go for your migration and, expert guidance in the form of prescriptive journey templates. Another benefit is cost savings because there is no charge to use Migration Hub.
**Use cases:** You can use Migration Hub for migration assessment and planning and migration completion and collaboration with teams. You can also use it for modernization efforts like fast-tracking application refactoring.

## Migrate and modernize phase

As you start moving resources to the cloud, you might continue to use Migration Hub to track your progress. You can also use Migration Hub during migration to modernize your applications. In following lessons, you will explore database and data migrations. But first, let's look at another service that focuses on your application migration, Application Migration Service.

## Application Migration Service
Application Migration Service is a tool to move and improve your on-premises and cloud-based applications. It helps customers streamline, expedite, and reduce the cost of migrating and modernizing applications.
**Benefits:** The benefits include support to migrate from any source infrastructure that runs a supported operating system (OS). It makes it possible to modernize your applications during migration. You can maintain normal business operations during the application replication process and also reduce costs by using one tool for a wide range of applications.
**Use cases:** You can use the Application Migration Service for on-premises applications running on physical servers or infrastructure, cloud-based applications, or moving between AWS Regions. You can also use it to modernize applications.

## Migration resources
## AWS Migration and Modernization Competency Partners
When migrating to the AWS Cloud, if you need help and expertise, you don't have to go it alone. You can work with the AWS Competency Partner Program. You can search for AWS Migration and Modernization Service Partners who specialize in specific phases of the migration or the type of help you need.
