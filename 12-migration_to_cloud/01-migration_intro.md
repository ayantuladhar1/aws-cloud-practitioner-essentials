Cloud migration refers to the process of moving your organization's digital assets, IT resources, applications, and databases from on-premises infrastructure to the AWS Cloud. This involves strategic planning, implementation, and ongoing management to achieve a smooth and successful transition. It is not typically a one and done type of move. With large migrations, companies might migrate in phases or stages.

## Three phases of the migration process
AWS helps guide companies through the migration process, which can be divided into three sequential phases. From the first phase to the last, there are AWS services and tools to support your migration. Although this is not an exhaustive list of every AWS migration service, these core migration services will help get you on your way.
To learn more about the migration phases, choose each of the numbered markers.

While AWS Migration Hub helps you mobilize your resources, you can use it as a one-stop place to also manage during the migrate and modernize phase. You will learn more about Migration Hub and the other migration services in the next lesson.
