Many customers prefer online migrations, but there are some customers who need to transfer data offline. An example would be if bandwidth is limited, or in remote locations with no internet and Direct Connect is not an option. Or, in cases with large data volumes, sending petabytes of data over the internet would take longer than simply sending a physical device.
