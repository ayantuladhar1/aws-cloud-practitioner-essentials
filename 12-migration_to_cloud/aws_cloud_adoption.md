# AWS Cloud Adoption Framework
In this lesson, you will explore the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) and the six perspectives to remember as you get started.

## Improve your cloud readiness
When you migrate to the AWS Cloud, there are critical planning tasks, many groups of stakeholders, and best practices to consider. With so much to take into account, it can seem overwhelming to even know where to start. That's where the AWS CAF can help.

## AWS CAF
The AWS CAF is a framework that brings AWS experience and best practices to companies preparing to migrate to the AWS Cloud. The framework provides tools to help accelerate the migration journey, organize resources, and align management during the transition.

**Benefits:** AWS CAF provides benefits for migrations to reduce business risk and improve sustainability and corporate transparency. Companies can grow revenue by creating new products and services in their cloud transformation. They can also reduce operational costs, increase productivity, and improve customer experience in their new cloud environment.

**Use cases:** You can use AWS CAF to migrate technology like legacy infrastructure and applications. You can also use it to migrate and optimize business processes, operations, and even create new business models with the move to the cloud.

## Functional and business-related stakeholders
There are several groups of stakeholders and various parts of the business to consider in your migration planning and readiness.
