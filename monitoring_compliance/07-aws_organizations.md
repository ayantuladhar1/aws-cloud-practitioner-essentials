# AWS Organizations
As companies grow and scale, the management and governance of disparate AWS accounts can be a challenge. That's where AWS Organizations can help.

## AWS Organizations
Organizations helps you centrally manage and govern your environment as you grow and scale your AWS resources. It helps you manage policies for groups of accounts and automate account creation.

## Benefits:
Organizations provides several benefits like quickly scaling your environment by programmatically creating new AWS accounts for resources and teams. It also helps by simplifying permission management through SCPs and managing and optimizing costs across your AWS accounts and resources.

## Use cases:
It can be used for automating AWS account creation, providing tools and access for your security teams, controlling user access to designated services, and sharing common resources across accounts.

## Key concepts of Organizations
An organization is a collection of AWS accounts that you can manage centrally and organize into a hierarchical, tree-like structure with a root at the top and organizational units (OUs) nested under the root. Each account can be located directly in the root or placed in one of the OUs in the hierarchy.
