## Watch over your resources and applications
## Amazon CloudWatch
CloudWatch monitors your AWS resources and the applications that you run on AWS in real time. With CloudWatch, you gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational health.  CloudWatch does more than just monitor. It has several features that work together:
* CloudWatch metrics
* CloudWatch alarms
* CloudWatch dashboards
* CloudWatch logs
To learn more about each CloudWatch feature, choose each of the following four numbered markers.

Benefits: CloudWatch helps you visualize and analyze your resources, operate efficiently with automation, use an integrated view, proactively monitor, and gain insights.
Use case: It can be used to monitor and troubleshoot infrastructure.
Example: A retail company is using CloudWatch features to monitor their application running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. CloudWatch automatically collects metrics, like utilization, on the EC2 instances. The company sets up CloudWatch to collect logs on the application performance. They also have alarms for when the Amazon EC2 utilization gets too high for an extended period. They even have an action configured to automate and scale up the number of EC2 instances when the alarm sounds. Finally, they create a custom dashboard to visualize everything all in one place. Now they can analyze the logs to gain insights on performance issues or application errors.
