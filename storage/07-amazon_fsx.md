Amazon FSx makes it convenient and cost effective to launch, run, and scale feature-rich, high-performance file systems in the cloud. It supports a wide range of workloads with its reliability, security, scalability, and broad set of capabilities. Compared to Amazon EFS, which focuses on the Network File System (NFS) compatibility, Amazon FSx supports multiple filesystem protocols, including Windows File Server, Lustre, OpenZFS, and NetAPP ONTAP.
Amazon FSx is built on the latest AWS compute, networking, and disk technologies to provide high performance and lower total cost of ownership (TCO). As a fully managed service, it handles hardware provisioning, patching, and backups.
