# AWS marketplace on AWS Partners
In this lesson, you dive into two critical components of the AWS landscape: the AWS Marketplace and the AWS Partner Network (APN). Whether you are looking to find specialized software solutions or you are seeking to enhance your own company’s offerings through partnership with AWS, understanding these components is an important part of your learning journey.

## AWS Marketplace and AWS Partner Network
## AWS Marketplace
The AWS Marketplace is a digital catalog that includes thousands of software listings from independent software vendors. You can use AWS Marketplace to find, test, and buy software that runs on AWS. For each listing in AWS Marketplace, you can access detailed information on pricing options and reviews from other AWS customers. Solutions and services offered in the AWS Marketplace include the following:
**Software as a service (SaaS):**  
* Business applications such as project management tools
* Marketing tools such as customer engagement platforms
* Collaboration tools such as file sharing services
	
**Machine learning (ML) and AI:**  
* Prebuilt models for image recognition, natural language processing, and more
* ML algorithms for training custom models

**Data and analytics:**  
* Business intelligence platforms for visualization and reporting
* Data integration tools
 
You can also explore software solutions by industry and use case. For example, suppose your company is in the healthcare industry. In AWS Marketplace, you can review use cases that software helps you to address, such as implementing solutions to protect patient records or using machine learning models to analyze a patient’s medical history and predict possible health risks.

## AWS Partner Network
The AWS Partner Network (APN) is a global community that uses AWS technologies, programs, expertise, and tools to build solutions and services for customers. Together, partners and AWS provide innovative solutions, solve technical challenges, and deliver customer value.
You can work with AWS Partners to create or use specialized solutions that are tailored to your unique business needs. For example, a retail company might use AWS to host their website. They could then work with an AWS Partner who specializes in advanced analytics and machine learning to improve customer personalization on that website.
