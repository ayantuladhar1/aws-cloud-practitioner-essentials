# AWS Pricing and Billing Services

In this lesson, you learn about specific AWS services that you can use to manage and optimize AWS costs. First, you will cover the concept of consolidated billing in AWS Organizations. Then, you will learn about some services that you can use to view, track, and forecast expenses.

## AWS pricing and billing services
You learned about various AWS pricing and billing services and tools. These services are purpose-built to help you forecast, track, manage, and view your AWS costs. When you are first starting out with the AWS Cloud, they can be hard to tell apart. To help you differentiate the services, let's review these services and their key uses cases.

## AWS Organizations
AWS Organizations provides centralized management and governance of your AWS environment. Using AWS Organizations, you can create, group, and manage accounts. You can also apply security policies at the account level and consolidate billing with multiple accounts using a single payment method.

## Use cases:
* Consolidate multiple AWS accounts into one central organization.
* Implement organization-wide policies.

## AWS Billing and Cost Management dashboard
The AWS Billing and Cost Management dashboard centralizes cost management, showing current charges, usage, forecasts, and detailed breakdowns. It also provides tools to manage payments, view invoices, set budgets, and consolidate billing.

## Use cases:
* Use helpful visualizations and billing reports of monthly AWS spend.
* Set up and manage payment methods.

## AWS Budgets
AWS Budgets helps set custom budgets and sends alerts when costs, usage, or Savings Plans and Reserved Instances (RIs) utilization or coverage exceed defined thresholds.

## Use cases:
* Set up alerts for when projected costs exceed predefined thresholds.
* Forecast future expenses based on current usage trends.

## AWS Cost Explorer
AWS Cost Explorer helps visualize, analyze, and manage AWS costs and usage with interactive graphs, reports, and forecasts. It provides insights into spending patterns, trends, and Reserved Instance recommendations.

## Use cases:
* Analyze historical spending trends to identify cost-saving opportunities.
* Forecast future AWS costs based on current usage patterns to budget effectively.

## AWS Pricing Calculator
Another helpful tool is the AWS Pricing Calculator. The AWS Pricing Calculator is a web-based planning tool that you can use to create estimates. You input specific configurations such as instance types, storage options, and data transfer volumes. Then, based on your configurations, you receive a detailed cost breakdown to help you budget for your AWS resource allocation.

## Use cases:
* Estimate potential costs before deployment.
* Compare costs of different AWS services and configurations.
