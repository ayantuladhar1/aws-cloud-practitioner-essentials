# AWS Pricing Concepts
AWS offers customers a pay-as-you-go approach for pricing for the vast majority of our cloud services. With AWS, customers pay only for the individual services they need, for as long as they use them, and without requiring long-term contracts or complex licensing. In this lesson, you learn more about the three key concepts of AWS pricing. You also learn about the primary elements that drive customer cost.

## Key concepts of AWS pricing
To review the three key concepts of how you pay for AWS services, choose each of the following cards.

## Driving factors of cost
The pricing of AWS services varies based on several factors, such as service category or type, configuration, AWS Region, and which pricing model you choose. Refer to the pricing tab on a service's webpage for details on its specific pricing factors. 
There are three fundamental drivers of cost with AWS: compute, storage, and outbound data transfer. These driving factors impact AWS service categories in different ways. To learn how compute, storage, and outbound data transfer drive cost at AWS, expand each of the following factors.
	
**Compute**  
For compute resources, you pay by a certain span of time, like by the hour or by the second. Unless you've made a reservation for which the cost is agreed upon beforehand, you pay from the time you launch a resource until the time you stop the instance.
	
**Storage**  
You can choose from a broad portfolio of storage solutions with deep functionality for storing, accessing, protecting, and analyzing data. Pricing for storage largely depends on how much storage you have provisioned or how much you are using.
For some storage options, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), storage cost is tiered. This means you can optimize storage costs based on how frequently and quickly you need to access data. With Amazon S3, consider the following six cost components when storing and managing customer data:
* Storage pricing
* Request and data retrieval pricing
* Data transfer and transfer acceleration pricing
* Data management and analytics pricing
* Replication pricing
* The price to process your data with Amazon S3 Object Lambda

**Data transfer**  
In most cases, there is no charge for inbound data transfer or for data transfer between AWS services within the same Region. There are some exceptions, so be sure to verify data transfer rates before beginning. 
Outbound data transfer is aggregated across services and then charged at the outbound data transfer rate. The more data you transfer, the less you pay per gigabyte. For data storage and transfer, you typically pay per gigabyte.

## AWS pricing scenario
Let's apply these AWS pricing concepts and drivers of cost to a possible scenario. Use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), a service in the compute category, as an example. 
An AWS customer decides to provision an EC2 instance for their nonprofit organization. To learn how this customer's EC2 instance might be impacted by the driving cost factors of compute, storage, and data transfer, choose each of the numbered markers.

As noted, these three factors impact each service category and AWS service differently. Please refer to the pricing tab of a service's webpage to learn how these factors impact price.
