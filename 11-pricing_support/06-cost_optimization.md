# Cost Optimization

By now, you have a solid idea of the fundamentals of AWS pricing and support. In this lesson, you apply some of the concepts you learned, reviewing how these services and ideas work together in real life. You explore a hypothetical example to learn about some helpful cost optimization techniques, and you review an architectural diagram that describes how these techniques work from a cloud architectural perspective.

## Cost optimization architecture diagram
Let's review the solutions discussed in the video. The following architecture diagram demonstrates a few different ways for optimizing costs in the cloud. To learn more about this architecture focused on cost optimization, choose each of the four numbered markers.
