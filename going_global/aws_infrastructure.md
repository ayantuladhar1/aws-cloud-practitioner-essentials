The coffee shop is expanding to global locations. Navigate through the following content to review how elements of our coffee shop expansion represent different parts of the AWS Global Infrastructure.

## How to choose a Region or set of Regions
If we were to expand our coffee shop by opening new locations, there would be multiple things to consider like customer demand and development cost. Similarly, you have several factors to consider when selecting a Region or set of Regions for your real-life resources.

## AWS Edge Locations
Like our coffee franchise could expand with smaller versions of the shop such as mobile coffee carts, AWS has smaller footprint facilities called edge locations. Edge locations cache items like images, videos and other resources so that users can access the content they need with lower latency.

## Infrastructure as code and CloudFormation
Another important consideration of a coffee shop expansion would be to maintain consistent product from location to  location. AWS has services such as CloudFormation that you can use to help automate the deployment of your cloud resources. These services use infrastructures as code or IaC helping you achieve a consistent reliable set up each time your business grows.
