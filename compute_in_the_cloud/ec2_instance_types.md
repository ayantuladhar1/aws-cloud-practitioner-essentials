# EC2 instance types
Amazon EC2 offers a broad range of instance types, each tailored to meet specific use case requirements. These instances come with varying combinations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capabilities so you can choose the right mix of resources to optimize performance for your applications.

## General Purpose:

These instance provide a balanced mix of compute, memory, and networking resources. They are ideal for diverse workloads, like web services, code repositories, and when workload performance is uncertain.

## Compute optimized:

These instances are ideal for compute-intensive tasks, such as gaming servers, high performance computing (HPC), machine learning, and specific modeling.

## Memory optimized:
