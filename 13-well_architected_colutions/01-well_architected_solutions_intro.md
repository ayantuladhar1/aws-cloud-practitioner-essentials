Before we cross the finish line, let’s take a quick pause and appreciate how far you’ve come. You’ve been introduced to a wide range of AWS services, learned how to piece them together, and gained a strong foundation for building in the cloud. But you are not done yet. With only a few topics left, it’s time to level up your understanding even further. In this next section, we will highlight a few more AWS services—ones designed for development, business applications, end-user computing, and Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. Plus, you will be introduced to a powerful resource that helps you assess whether your cloud architecture is functional, efficient, secure, and built to last: the AWS Well-Architected Framework.
