Building and maintaining a secure environment in the cloud is an important responsibility. AWS shares this responsibility with its customers. In the following lessons, you will learn about important security concepts, mechanisms, and services that help protect your cloud resources on AWS.

## Key concepts
Authentication and authorization are two mechanisms that play a big role in data privacy and system protection. Let's review these concepts and dive a little deeper into how security works in the AWS shared responsibility model.

## AWS shared responsibility model
Cloud security is a shared responsibility between customers and AWS. Let's examine this relationship using the AWS shared responsibility model.

## Customers: Security in the cloud
When using AWS services, customers maintain complete control over their content. As a result, customers are responsible for securing everything they create and manage in the AWS Cloud. This includes the following:
* Managing the security of data, systems, and applications
* Deciding what data and workloads to store or run in AWS
* Determining which AWS services to use
* Controlling who has access to environments and resources

## AWS: Security of the cloud
AWS is responsible for security of the cloud. AWS operates, manages, and controls the components at all layers of the infrastructure. This includes securing the following:
* The foundational software that powers AWS services
* The virtualization layer
* The hardware and global infrastructure that supports the data centers from which services operate. This includes protection for AWS Regions, Availability Zones, and edge locations.
