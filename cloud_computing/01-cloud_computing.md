It is on  demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay as you go pricing.
* On-Demand Delivery
  * On-demand delivery means that customers can access computing resources, such as storage or computer power, within seconds and  
* Of IT resources
  * The of IT resources aspect highlights the wide array of information technology assets in the cloud-computing space. These resources include servers, storage solutions, databases, networking components, artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) tools, and more. Customers can use these resources to build, deploy, and manage applications and services through the cloud infrastructure.
* Over the Internet
  * Over the internet signifies that cloud computing delivers IT resources through internet connectivity. This means that user access and use these resources through web-based service rather than maintaining local hardware or software. The internet acts as the conduit, which provides remote access to compute power, storage, and applications from anywhere in the world.
* With Pay-as-you-go pricing
  * Flexible pricing is a fundamental economic aspect of cloud computing. Users pay only for the resources they actually consume, rather than committing to fixed, long-term contracts. This usage-based pricing model offers cost efficiency and financial flexibility. 
	
## Cloud deployment types
You can deploy cloud resources in multiple ways: cloud, on-premises, and hybrid. Each type offers unique benefits and considerations, and exploring these option can help you make informed decisions about your cloud strategy. The following are different types of cloud deployment,

In cloud-based deployment model, you have the flexibility to migrate your existing resources to the cloud, design and build new applications within the cloud environment, or use a combination of both. For instance, a company might migrate data resources to the cloud, then develop an application comprised of virtual servers, databases, and networking components entirely hosted in the cloud.

Deploying resources on premises using virtualization and resource management tools does not provide many of the benefits of cloud computing. However it is sometimes sought for its ability to provide dedicated resources and low latency. In most cases this deployment model is the same as legacy IT infrastructure while using application management and virtualization technologies to try increasing resource utilization.

In hybrid deployment, cloud-based resources and on-premises infrastructure work together. This approach is ideal for situations where legacy applications must remain on premises due to maintenance preferences or regulatory requirements. For instance, a company might choose to retain certain regulated legacy applications on-premises while using cloud services for advanced data processing and analytics.
