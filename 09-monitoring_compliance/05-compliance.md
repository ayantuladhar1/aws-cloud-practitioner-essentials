# Compliance

## Benefits of compliance with AWS
Compliance refers to your cloud resources and data adhering to relevant regulations, industry standards, and internal policies regarding security and data protection. AWS helps you meet compliance goals and requirements in the following ways:
* Inheriting the latest security controls that AWS uses on its own infrastructure
* Third-party validation for thousands of global requirements
* Streamlining and automating compliance
* On-demand compliance reports

## AWS Artifact
AWS Artifact is a service that provides no-cost, on-demand access to AWS security and compliance reports and select online agreements.

## Benefits:
AWS Artifact helps you manage at scale, save time with on-demand access to compliance reports, and deploy with more confidence.

## Use cases:
It can be used to manage select online agreements and assess third-party security and compliance.

## AWS Artifact consists of two types:
* AWS Artifact agreements and AWS Artifact reports.
* To learn more about the two types, expand each of the following two categories.

## AWS Artifact Agreements
Suppose that your company needs to sign an agreement with AWS regarding your use of certain types of information throughout AWS services. You can do this through AWS Artifact Agreements.
In AWS Artifact Agreements, you can review, accept, and manage agreements for an individual account and for all your accounts in AWS Organizations. Different types of agreements are offered to address the needs of customers who are subject to specific regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

## AWS Artifact Reports
Next, suppose that a member of your company’s development team is building an application and needs more information about their responsibility for complying with certain regulatory standards. You can advise them to access this information in AWS Artifact Reports.
AWS Artifact Reports provide compliance reports from third-party auditors. These auditors have tested and verified that AWS is compliant with a variety of global, regional, and industry-specific security standards and regulations. AWS Artifact Reports remains up to date with the latest reports released. You can provide the AWS audit artifacts to your auditors or regulators as evidence of AWS security controls.
