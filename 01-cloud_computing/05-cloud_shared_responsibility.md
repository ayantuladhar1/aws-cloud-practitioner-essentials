## Customer responsibilities
Customers are responsible for managing security requirements for their data, including which data they store on AWS and who has access to that data. Customers also control how access to the data is granted, managed and revoked.
Additionally, customers are responsible for client-side encryption.

## Customer on AWS Responsibility (Shared Responsibility)
Depending on the service used, responsibilities might shift between the customer and AWS. Components such as server-side encryption, network traffic protection, platform and application management, and OS, network, and firewall configuration vary by service in terms of who is responsible for these items. As you learn more about different types of services, you will see specific examples of how these elements are divided between the customer and AWS.

## AWS responsibilities
AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all the services offered in the AWS Cloud. This infrastructure is composed of hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run Cloud services.
